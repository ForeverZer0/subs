# Subs

Subs aims for making fetching subtitles for all your favorite movies and television shows a few keystrokes away using a simple and intuitive command-line interface. It uses multiple search algorithms for determining the best matching subtitle for video files that it finds, including using provider hashing algorithms (preferred), filename and name, and IMDb IDs.

It currently ships with two primary providers that it can utilize, [SubDB](http://thesubdb.com/) and [OpenSubtitles](https://www.opensubtitles.org), as they both are open-source, and contain some of the largest collections of subtitles available anywhere. They both also expose a public API and custom hashing algorithm to drastically increase quality of results, and are much faster and more accurate than web-scraping. More providers will likely be added in the future.
 
Subs also comes with a utility for easily re-syncing existing SubRip (.srt) subtitle files if they do not match the video audio exactly. This feature is often included in video players, but this will allow for permanently saving the file with the corrected offset extremely easily.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'subs'
```

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install subs

## Usage

Once installed, open a terminal/command window and use the following basic syntax:
